# Secret Santa Assignment

## Overview
This project automates the process of assigning Secret Santa pairs while ensuring that:
- Each employee gets a unique secret child.
- Employees are not assigned to themselves.
- Employees are not assigned to the same person as in the previous year.
- The assignment process is optimized for efficiency (O(1) lookups and assignment).
